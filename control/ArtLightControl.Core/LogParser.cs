        // The client source says why: RTSP is used for setup only, and moonlight-common-c opens a
        // TCP connection per RTSP message and closes it at the end of the transaction
        // (RtspConnection.c, transactRtspMessageTcp), or skips TCP entirely on servers where it
        // uses ENet. The stream itself is UDP. So this is true only for the milliseconds of an
        // RTSP exchange during launch, and the comment above — "maintained for the entire
        // session" — was never true.
        //
        // It is therefore NOT a liveness signal, and nothing may be gated on a false result from
        // it. Callers to re-examine: LinkSpeedManager.LiveSessionProbe (the guard meant to stop a
        // client renegotiating the adapter mid-stream) and StreamingLogMonitor Phase 2.
        // The obvious replacement was tried and does NOT fit either. GET
        // http://127.0.0.1:47989/serverinfo answers unauthenticated with <state> and <currentgame>,
        // and it does track a session: measured 04/09/2026, BUSY within a second of CLIENT
        // CONNECTED, FREE within one poll of the client going away. But a second measurement, with
        // the client disconnected and the game left running, showed it stays BUSY with nobody
        // attached (15:07:43 disconnect → still BUSY at 15:07:51 and 15:08:02 → FREE only at
        // 15:08:24, once the game was gone). So <state> means "a session or its app is up", not
        // "a client is streaming", and it must NOT be wired into the guards here: a client that
        // drops and relaunches would be refused its SETSPEED for as long as the game stays up —
        // the relaunch case LinkSim S16 exists to protect.
        //
        // Net: there is no known live-stream signal available to the host today except the
