   * captured display's refresh, e.g. 2.156 ms for a 116 FPS stream on a 4x
   * virtual display. The stamper listens to Microsoft-Windows-DXGI Present
   * events of the foreground process through a shared real-time ETW session and
   * moves each stamp to where that game's present cadence places it inside the
   * composition refresh. Without ETW access or a matching present the stamp is
   * the middle of the refresh, so it never moves more than one refresh from the
   * composition time.
   *
   * Refinement runs when the encoded frame is packetized, not when it is
   * captured: by then the present that produced it has almost always been
   * delivered by ETW, which batches events. Calls must come from one thread,
   * in frame order.
