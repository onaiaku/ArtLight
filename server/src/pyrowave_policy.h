   * unlimited boundary). The layout lets a receiver decode a frame that lost packets
   * (docs/pyrowave-protocol.md):

   * 2. The coarsest wavelet level, which a receiver cannot do without: its shards
   *    (`critical_bytes`) are the ones stream.cpp protects with parity.
   * 3. Every other record.
   *
   * Within groups 2 and 3, oversized records (too large to share a shard with a
   * padding record) come first, in frame order. They span shards; a minimal padding
   * record goes before one that would otherwise end 4 bytes before a boundary. The
   * group's other records follow, packed first-fit: a shard remainder takes the
   * earliest record of the group that fits it, and a padding record fills it only
   * when none fits. None of them crosses a shard boundary and no 4-byte remainder
   * (too small for a padding record) is left, so every shard after the finer
   * level's oversized records starts with a record.
   *
   * Measured padding is well under 1% of the frame, against about 20% when records
   * keep strict order.
